        <h2>Project Overview</h2>

        <ul>
        <p>The Blockbuster Recommendation System project is a designed recommendation system for movie and series streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, or Disney+. Using available movie data, we will create an algorithm to measure similarity between different movie and series characteristics (item features) like genre, subtopics, actors, viewer rating, release date, and popularity. Not only that, but the algorithm will also be able to recommend movies or series that are available in the specified user language and country (some film content is only available in certain languages and countries). Based on the similarity calculations, the algorithm will generate five recommendations for each of the nearly 10,000 movies and series available in the data set. On the final platform, users will be able to select any movie or series from the interface and the top five recommendations will be displayed. This is a purely content-based recommendation system.</p>

        <h2>Project Justification</h2>

        <ul>
        <p>Presently, most companies are using some sort of recommendation system in their business for interacting with consumers. Whether it is a streaming platform, an online clothing retailer, or a grocery store chain, companies are using their available data to build personalized recommendation systems to enhance the user experience. Therefore, learning the skill of algorithm design and implementation for real-world usage is key for the development of a computer or data scientist. In addition, I believe the movie information data set (with the available variables) allows for in-depth analysis to find similarity between items, while also possessing strong information for creating the user interface (i.e., the IMDb link, the specific poster, and the trailer). Overall, this data set has all the necessary features for creating and designing a recommendation system like most companies of the present day, and this is an essential skill for entering the job market in data science.</p>
