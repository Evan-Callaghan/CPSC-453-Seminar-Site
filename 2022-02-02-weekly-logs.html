        <h2>Jan. 31 - Feb. 4</h2>
        <p style="border:#004D99; padding: 15px; border-width:3px; border-style:solid;"> This week I have completed the high-level project diagram, finalized all data set cleaning processes, finished the initial/basic algorithm design, and started this website. My next steps for the project are to complete all variable engineering processes for the data set, to implement the designed algorithm, to evaluate and tweak the algorithm as necessary, to buy/set up a domain for the webpage, and to continue to improve the content/design of the webpage. So far, the variable engineering steps have been tricky (because of the way the data is stored), so I am going through this processes carefully. The data set has a lot of variety in terms of available countries, languages, and genres, so I am excited/hopeful for a good recommendation engine. Overall, the Blockbuster Recommendation Project is on schedule.</p>

      <h2>Feb. 7 - Feb. 11</h2>
      <p style="border:#004D99; padding: 15px; border-width:3px; border-style:solid;">This week I completed the recommendation system algorithm design, added over 200 new categorical variable identifiers for the Euclidean distance calculation (part of algorithm), and found way for simplifying the variable engineering Python code. My next steps for the project are to complete the algorithm implementation, reassess the input variables and add more where necessary, buy the website domain name, and begin working with the program interface. I made a few tweaks when it comes to country availability and languages - I am only choosing movies/series that are available in the top-11 most popular languages (because of the number of observations associated with that language), and I am totally removing the country availability aspect. With these changes, I believe the recommendations for the selected languages will be stronger, and we are no longer restriction on country. Also, these changes (fewer observations) will better allow the algorithm to run on my local machine, as opposed to purchasing computing time through AWS. </p>

      <h2>Feb. 14 - Feb. 18</h2>
      <p style="border:#004D99; padding: 15px; border-width:3px; border-style:solid;"> This week I have completed some edits to the website formatting, finished all variables engineering processes, and finished the algorithm implementation. Since the algorithm depends on Euclidean distance for distinguishing movies and series from others, having as many observation features as possible is beneficial as long as they are all on the same scale. With the information available in the original data set, I have been able to engineer just less than 1,000 additional categorical variables (0 or 1) that can be used to better measure similarity between observations. These variables are all based on movie/series genre and movie/series genre tags (similar to genre, but more broad). Overall, this will help to really distinguish movies and series that are the most similar. Even with this many variables, the Euclidean distances can still be computed on my local machine in a short period of time. I also completed the algorithm implementation (high-level design posted in "Details" tab), but this will be slightly adjusted based on what information I want to be extracted from each recommendation. Next up, I need to begin designing the program interface and determine what information I need extracted from each recommended movie/series. I also need to purchase the domain name for this site and configure it to GitHub Pages.</p>

      <h2>Feb. 21 - Feb. 25</h2>
      <p style="border:#004D99; padding: 15px; border-width:3px; border-style:solid;"> This week I uploaded all site code to GitHub pages, purchased the website domain name (BlockbusterRecommendations.com), completed more edits to the website formatting, and began the initial planning stages of the movie recommendation user interface. I am still considering what platform to use for the user interface, but the testing has been successful so far. This testing has also allowed me to see what information I need to extract from the algorithm for each recommended movie or series. This information will be displayed as a quick look/summary on the interface. In the next few weeks, I need to finalize the implemented algorithm (extracting proper information), continue designing the interface, and create a mid-semester progress report for the project (due March 9).</p>

      <h2>Feb. 28 - Mar. 4</h2>
      <p style="border:#004D99; padding: 15px; border-width:3px; border-style:solid;"> In this week's work I completed the high-level desing of the recommendation system user interface and started to create this using visualizations in Tableau. My vision for the interface is to look something like that of Netflix or Hulu. There should be a search engine feature to access any movie or series in any language. There should be a way to query the data which filters based on genre, language, and viewer rating. And there should be sections relating to each of the most popular genres. Because of the recommendation aspect of this project, I'd like for movie recommendations to be nicely displayed with the applicable movie poster, image, and IMDb link for the user to have a better idea of what the movie or series is. With all of this considered, I know that a detailed Tableau dashboard will be a perfect tool for creating this proof-of-concept user interface for the recommendation system. In terms of next steps, I will continue to tweak and refine the interface, as well as start to look at final deliverables for the project.</p>
